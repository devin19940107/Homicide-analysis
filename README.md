# HOMICIDE ANALYSIS DOCUMENTATION
This was my course project. Recently I redesigned the database schema and modified the code to echo the new database.
The original project and idea is the brainchild of me and my teammate 
**Anouer Hermassi**.


Data and documentation can be acquired from [http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html](http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html)

It recorded 771025 cases from 1976 to 2017.

*Declaration : Out of the nature of science, part of the analysis may involve gender and race, nevertheless, any form of discrimination is not be advocated.*
