# HOMICIDE ANALYSIS DOCUMENTATION
This was my second semester project. Recently I redesigned the database schema and modified the code.
The original project and idea is me and my teamate 
**Anouer Hermassi**.


Data and documentation can be acquired from [http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html](http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html)

It recorded 702105 cases from 1976 to 2017.

*Declaration : Out of the nature of science, part of the analysis may involve gender and race, nevertheless, any form of discrimination is not be advocated.*
